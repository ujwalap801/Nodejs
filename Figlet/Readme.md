# Node.js Project Structure

In a typical Node.js project, you will encounter three important components: `node_modules`, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json`. Each plays a crucial role in managing dependencies and project metadata.

## 1. `node_modules`

The `node_modules` directory is where all the packages and their dependencies are installed when you use NPM (Node Package Manager). This folder contains all the libraries your project depends on, as specified in the `package.json` file.

### Key Points

- **Automatic Creation**: The `node_modules` directory is automatically created when you run `npm install`.
- **Local Installation**: Packages installed without the `-g` (global) flag are stored in this directory, making them accessible only within the current project.
- **Size**: This directory can become quite large, as it may contain many nested dependencies.

### Example

```bash
my-app/
  ├── node_modules/
  ├── package.json
  └── package-lock.json



# package.json

The `package.json` file is a crucial file in any Node.js project. It serves as the manifest for the project, containing metadata about the project and its dependencies.
The package.json file contains descriptive and functional metadata about a project, such as a name, version and dependencies
Even if we lost nodemodules, by packagejson we get get our dependencies
## Key Features

- **Project Metadata**: 
  - Includes the project name, version, description, entry point, scripts, and author information.

- **Dependencies**: 
  - Lists the packages that your project requires to run. 
  - Dependencies can be categorized into regular dependencies and development dependencies.



# package-lock.json

The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated when you run `npm install`. It locks the versions of your dependencies, ensuring that the exact same versions are installed every time you (or someone else) set up the project.
It records the exact version of every installed dependency, including its sub-dependencies and their versions

## Key Features

- **Version Locking**: 
  - Contains the exact versions of dependencies and their dependencies, preventing potential compatibility issues when installing packages.

- **Performance**: 
  - Speeds up the installation process by allowing NPM to skip certain steps when the `package-lock.json` file is present.

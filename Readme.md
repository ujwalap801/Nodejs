# Node.js

Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime environment** that is used for **server-side programming**.

- Node.js is **not** a language, library, or framework.
- It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser.


Node.js is a **runtime environment** that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Traditionally, JavaScript was used only for client-side scripting in web browsers, but Node.js extends its capabilities to server-side development. Built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js allows you to build **fast**, **scalable**, and **efficient** web applications.

## Common Use Cases:

- **Web Servers**: Building RESTful APIs and backend services.
- **Real-Time Applications**: Such as chat applications, gaming servers, and collaborative tools.
- **Microservices**: Used in distributed system architectures for small, independent services.
- **Command Line Tools**: Developing scripts that run in a server environment.

Node.js is widely used by companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, and PayPal for building fast and scalable applications



# Node.js REPL

The **Node REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive shell that allows you to write and execute JavaScript code line by line directly in your terminal or command prompt using Node.js. It reads the input, evaluates it, prints the result, and then loops back for the next command, making it useful for testing code snippets, debugging, or learning how JavaScript behaves.

## Key Features of Node.js REPL:

- **Read**: Reads the input from the user.
- **Eval**: Evaluates the JavaScript code entered.
- **Print**: Prints the result of the evaluated expression.
- **Loop**: Waits for the next input, making the process continuous.


# Running Node.js Files

To run Node.js files, use the following command:
